# ATmegaLabStation
My approach to create My own Lab Station (Power supply + soldering station) with help of ATmega8 on board 


History
=======
07.06.2020
I start with bouth of old not working audio aplifiler Grundig v4200. Why? The bese for every power supply is a good tranformer. And what we have on v4200? 
09092-001.02:
2x25V~ 150W
1x22V~ 50W
Termal protection - trancformer will cut it out when its rich 130 degree. 
After rectifier this will give use 2x33V (~2A) for power supply and one 28V (~1.5A) for soldering station. 
Except tranformer v4200 have good audio grade power supply filter unit that I plan to use in my project. 
Except this item I thin I will usen many other component from this unit but more about this in the future 



Cost:
=====
Grundig v4200 - 34 PLN + 18 PLN shipment
